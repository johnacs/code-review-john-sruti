## Review

#### Project Purpose

This app is created as part of the WDI course fulfillment.

Kitchen Wonders has been created as a food delivery app by home cooks and stay at home moms. Each chef has a list of dishes( and also cuisines) and the customer can place the order if he wishes to after login. The customer can also review the chef in the 'Add a review' section. In order to become a chef, a user can create a Chef account and add his/her information.


#### Project Organization

* Code organised in MVC format

#### Features

* Has search functions
* Homepage slider is a nice feature

#### Areas of Success (Code, Organization)

* Good use of the search functions
* Good use of user stories on trello.com


#### Areas for Improvement (Code, Organization)

* UX : Use of text color. Some background images makes it difficult to see the text
* At the chef edit:
  * Would be good to be able to edit existing dishes
  * Need to validate empty form when adding a blank recipe
