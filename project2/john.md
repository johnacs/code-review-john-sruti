## Review

#### Project Purpose

PRONTO

The project implements an Coffee ordering system and is inspired from Amazon Dash and uses an IOT device to place orders over the cloud.

#### Project Organization

#### Features

* Authentication
  * The admin can login to find all the current orders.
* Order on Delivery.
  * An IOT device has been programmed and is identified by an Id. When a user has this device, and clicks the button, the order is recognized by the Id and is registered into the database.
* Bootstrap
  * The front-end is implemented using Bootstrap framework.

#### Areas of Success (Code, Organization)

* Novel Idea
  * Though it is inspired from Amazon Dash, the methodical implementation right from the application development to programming the device for is very evident.
* Front-end is awesome.
  * The Bootstrap Themes by BoostrapMade.com has been used for the front end and looks visually very appealing.


#### Areas for Improvement (Code, Organization)

* Customer Feedback
  * No evident feedback to the customer once the order has been placed.
* Only Admin Account
  * Currently there is only an admin account. The option of providing a customer account would be beneficial to the customer to track his/her orders.
